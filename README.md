# Expo Camera Preview Issue with Custom Permissions

This repository demonstrates a rare bug encountered when using the Expo Camera API in conjunction with custom permission handling.  The camera preview may fail to render correctly, displaying a blank screen despite permissions being granted.  The problem appears to be related to an interaction between the Expo Camera API, custom permission requests, and potentially other Expo modules or native code.

The bug is intermittent and difficult to reproduce consistently across different devices and Android versions. This repository includes example code showcasing the issue and a proposed solution.
